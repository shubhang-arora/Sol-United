# Sol-United
Sol-United is a B2C solution for Innogy where Innogy’s Customers are Producers and Consumers of Power. 

# What we do:
Provide Innogy’s customers a hassle free technology to run their own solar panels with a simple set-up
An opportunity for the customers to make money by saving energy

# How it works:
The blockchain technology at the heart of the network connects the producers and consumer
When excess energy is produced by a Solar Panel (set-up by Innogy); the grid automatically sends the energy to the household that requires the energy
The Solar Panel system works 365 days a year; even when you’re on a holiday (so you can rely on your technology investment to make money when you’re away too)
